# TO-DO

- Honestly too much to list
- Get the data rending into something useful.
- Some sort of login/validation system <sub>how hard could this be<sub>

# Vision

I find keeping on track with goals a hard thing to do. I use many tools to help keep me motivated 
and always moving towards where I want to be, GitGood aim is to be another one of those tools.
